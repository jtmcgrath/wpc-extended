# WordPress Customizer Extended

This plugin provides a simplified interface for adding to and updating the Customizer, and is bundled with several custom controls and shorthands to make life easier.

## Plugin Extensions

### Automatic Sass Export

This child plugin adds automatic Sass export to the WPC Extended plugin. With both plugins installed, any customizer settings are compiled directly to Sass, and the live stylesheet is updated when the customizer settings are saved. Check out the child plugin repo for more information.

## Built With
