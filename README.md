# WordPress Customizer Extended

This plugin provides a simplified interface for adding to and updating the Customizer, and is bundled with several custom controls and shorthands to make life easier.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. *Note that this plugin has not been tested thoroughly, and is not intended for production use at present.*

### Installation

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Add customizer options in your theme's `functions.php` file.

## Plugin Extensions

### [Automatic Sass Export](https://github.com/jtmcgrath/wpc-extended-sass)

The [WPC Extended Sass](https://github.com/jtmcgrath/wpc-extended-sass) child plugin adds automatic Sass export to **WPC Extended**. With both plugins installed, any customizer settings are compiled directly to Sass, and the live stylesheet is updated when the customizer settings are saved. [Check out the child plugin repo for more information.](https://github.com/jtmcgrath/wpc-extended-sass)

## Documentation

The documentation only applies to the old structure of the plugin, before the Sass export functions were moved into a separate extension. Since I'm moving to a different country in the next few weeks, it might take a little while before I can fix this, but it will happen at some point! The old docs are now available in the [old-documentation](https://github.com/jtmcgrath/wpc-extended/tree/master/old-documentation) folder.

## Built With

- [Alpha Color Picker](https://github.com/BraadMartin/components/tree/master/customizer/alpha-color-picker) - Alpha colour picker Customizer control.
