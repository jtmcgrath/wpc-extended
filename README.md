## Plugin Extensions

### [Automatic Sass Export](https://github.com/jtmcgrath/wpc-extended-sass)

The [WPC Extended Sass](https://github.com/jtmcgrath/wpc-extended-sass) child plugin adds automatic Sass export to **WPC Extended**. With both plugins installed, any customizer settings are compiled directly to Sass, and the live stylesheet is updated when the customizer settings are saved.
